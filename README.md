Vagalume is the galician word for Firefly, and fireflies highlight in the
night with his ass, is not that so awesome? If you catch them in a jar, you have
an amazing and natural glowing lamp. 

Well, is not that natural and it is not a jar, but I tried to catch the spirit of
the fireflies and use it to highlight your code in the cold nights and glow it
in the warm days. Almost it was the idea!
