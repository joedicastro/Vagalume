Vagalume is the galician word for Firefly, and fireflies highlight in the
night with his ass, is not that so awesome? If you catch them in a jar, you have
an amazing and natural glowing lamp. 

Well, is not that natural and it is not a jar, but I tried to catch the spirit of
the fireflies and use it to highlight your code in the cold nights and glow it
in the warm days. Almost it was the idea!

# This is still a project, work in progress!!

## Features

- Dual mode: one for the warm days (light theme) & one for the cold nights (dark theme) 
- Made to work with GUIs (gui) and 256 color terminals (cterm)
- Provides a consistent style for the Vim interface (UI), the syntax for some
  filetypes and various plugins

## Supported filetypes

I intend to support the syntax highlighting for these filetypes:

- Python
- Django / Jinja
- Markdown
- Javascript & JSON
- HTML
- CSS 
- Ruby
- C
- Lua
- Haskell
- Vimscript
- Clojure
- Git (commits, logs, diffs, ...)
- bash
- crontab

- and probably more...

## Installation

Just stick vagalume.vim in your `colors/` directory, or use your favorite plugin
manager to install it (NeoBundle, Vundle, pathogen, ...)
